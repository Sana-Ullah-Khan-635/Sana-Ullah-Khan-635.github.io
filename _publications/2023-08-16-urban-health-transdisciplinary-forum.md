**Meeting Abstract**  
Urban homelessness is a common issue faced by both developed and developing countries due to the interplay of various causes, thus inviting a contextualized response mechanism to deal with the issue. In Germany, low income and medical issues have been reported as two of the most dominant causes of homelessness. Another study by the authors about homeless people staying in the Shelter Homes (locally known as Panah Gahs) of Lahore depicted that medical issues have been the cause of around 18% of all such homeless people. On the other hand, urban health is also impacted by urban living arrangements. The physical environment, social structures, and access to social services and health facilities affect urban health the most. Many urban homeless people live in unhygienic conditions, have disconnected social lives, and at times have been denied access to social and medical services for not having valid identity documents. All such issues significantly affect the physical and mental health of homeless people, creating a vicious circle in which poor health conditions both contribute to and are exacerbated by homelessness.

**Material and Methods:**  
By applying a mixed-methods research approach, 100 face-to-face interviews of homeless people found on the roadsides and open spaces in Lahore were conducted through random and convenience sampling to find out the socio-economic dynamics of their daily urban life.

**Results:**  
It has been observed that 91% of such homeless people found in Lahore were economic migrants. 94% were living on roadsides or in open spaces, vulnerable to harsh weather conditions and epidemics. Around 90% had household members living outside Lahore, resulting in weak family connections and negative impacts on mental health. About one-third lacked valid identity documents, which hindered their access to government-established shelter homes and other social services.

**Conclusion:**  
The evidence provides insight into the endangered health of the homeless people in Lahore. The study recommends an inclusive planning approach that is sensitive to the living, social, and healthcare needs of the homeless population.
