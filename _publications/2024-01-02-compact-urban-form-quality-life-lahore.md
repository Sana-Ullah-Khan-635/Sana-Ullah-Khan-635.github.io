**Abstract**  
Remorseless air pollution has threatened the fragile environment of our cities and traditional policy initiatives have failed to combat it. Revamping urban planning for the revitalization of urban air quality is the need of the day. Innovative urban planning strategies, such as the power of mixed land use, can contribute significantly to controlling air pollution. Furthermore, it is a great initiative to conform climate response planning in Lahore. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis has been used to verify an in-depth effect of mixed land uses on air quality indices. The paper suggests policy measures for the adoption of climate response spatial development.
