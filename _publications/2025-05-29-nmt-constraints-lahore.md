This paper presents an in-depth assessment of the constraints and barriers affecting non-motorized transport (NMT) usage in Lahore, Pakistan. Through a combination of empirical survey data, stakeholder interviews, and policy review, the study highlights the major physical, social, and institutional obstacles to the adoption of NMT, especially walking and cycling. Recommendations for improving infrastructure, governance, and public acceptance are discussed to promote sustainable urban mobility in South Asian cities.
