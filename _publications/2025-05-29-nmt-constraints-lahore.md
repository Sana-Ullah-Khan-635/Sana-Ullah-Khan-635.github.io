Abstract
A balanced infrastructure for both motorized and non-motorized transportation is one of the challenges for urban mobility in Lahore. With minimal consideration for non-motorized transport, most of Lahoreâ€™s road infrastructure has been designed for motorized transportation. Urban road networks are under stress due to the unrelenting plying of motor vehicles, which causes congestion for most of the day. The research explores existing barriers and difficulties that impact the utilization of non-motorized transport for sustainable urban mobility. Reliability analysis was applied to validate the response of households and experts. Regression Analysis was used to identify paramount constraints for the smooth operation of non-motorized transport. The paper recommends policy measures for rationalization and smooth operation of non-motorized transport in Lahore.
