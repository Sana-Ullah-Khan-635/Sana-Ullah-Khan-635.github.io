About Me
========

I am Khan M Sana Ullah, an urban planner and policy researcher currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Urban Science and Policy at Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU), Tokyo, Japan, as a MEXT Scholar. My research and practice center around sustainable urban development, mobility systems, spatiotemporal big data analysis, GIS, and evidence-based policy reform.

My journey into urban planning began with a deep curiosity about how cities can become more equitable, resilient, and livable. Through hands-on experience in both international development and local urban projects, I have seen first-hand how data-driven approaches can transform urban policy and everyday life. My mission is to bridge the gap between rigorous research and practical solutions for contemporary urban challenges.

üéì Academic Foundation

I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in City and Regional Planning from UET Lahore, where I graduated as a double Gold Medalist and received the Best Research Thesis Award. Building on this foundation, I am currently deepening my expertise in urban policy science, community-oriented planning, and advanced data analytics at TMU, Tokyo.

üí° Skills and Methods

My core skills include:
- Urban Mobility & Spatiotemporal Analysis
- GIS & Geospatial Data Science
- Python Programming & Data Analytics
- Quantitative & Qualitative Research
- Sustainable Urban Design
- Policy Analysis & Evidence-Based Planning

I am experienced with statistical modeling (SPSS, VOSviewer), geospatial platforms (ArcGIS), and developing visualizations and models to support policy decisions and urban planning interventions.

üß™ Research and Professional Experience

Previously, I served as a Project Officer (Urban Planning) at The Urban Unit and as a Junior Urban Planner at Tractebel (ADB-funded city master planning). My work has involved spatial master planning, stakeholder engagement, and leading research on topics such as green roofs, non-motorized transport, and urban housing.

As a researcher, I have published in international journals including *Case Studies on Transport Policy* and *Nature-Based Solutions*, focusing on topics like non-motorized transport constraints, green infrastructure, and the use of big data for urban mobility analysis.

üìç Current Research

At TMU, my research explores spatiotemporal dynamics of bicycle sharing services, land use, and urban accessibility in Tokyo. I employ Python, GIS, and advanced data science tools to uncover trends and generate actionable insights for city policymakers.

üéØ Future Aspirations

My vision is to help shape cities that are inclusive, walkable, and responsive to both environmental and social needs. I am committed to advancing data-driven urbanism, integrating community perspectives, and contributing to global knowledge on sustainable urban development.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for impact, I am always open to collaboration and dialogue on innovative approaches for better cities.
